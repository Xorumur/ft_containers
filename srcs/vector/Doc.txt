        CONSTRUCTORS: 

    default (1)	

    explicit vector (const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());

        Constructs an empty container, with no elements.

    fill (2)	

    explicit vector (size_type n, const value_type& val = value_type(),
                    const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());

        Constructs a container with n elements. Each element is a copy of val.

    range (3)	

    template <class InputIterator>
            vector (InputIterator first, InputIterator last,
                    const allocator_type& alloc = allocator_type());
        
        Constructs a container with as many elements as the range [first,last), with each element constructed from its corresponding element in that range, in the same order.


    copy (4)	

    vector (const vector& x);

        Constructs a container with a copy of each of the elements in x, in the same order.
